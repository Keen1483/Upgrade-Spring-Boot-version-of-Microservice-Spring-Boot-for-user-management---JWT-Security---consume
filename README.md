## Securing Spring Applications With OAuth2 and JWT

There are several ways to secure an application.
The most efficient way is to secure with OAuth2 and JWT.

In this project, I show how to manage authentication and
authorization in a Spring Boot application with OAuth and JWT.
I show how to configure the Header, Payload and Signature of a token;
how to create the access token and the refresh token and configure
their expiration time.

## Returns an http status corresponding to the response of the http request

The http status of http requests is essential for the operation of an API.
By default, some http status are ambiguous with respect to the http response,
which compromises the use of the API. It is therefore necessary to rewrite
the http status with the ResponseEntity object so that they are adapted to
the http responses.
